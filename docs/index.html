<p>This whole project was part of the e-Yantra Robotics Competition
organized by IIT - Bombay. The assets used belongs to e-Yantra.

The primary aim of the project is to automate the warehouse.
Vargi is taken from a Sanskrit word, Vargikaran (वर्गीकरण) which
means to separate objects based on their category. The theme 
is set in the abstraction of a warehouse management system 
designed in Gazebo, which is a 3D dynamic simulator used to 
efficiently simulate robots in complex environments. </p>

<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We all have ordered something online, for us it arrives at a click
of a button. But behind the scenes, there is a whole complex
logistics chain compromising of many people, who work day in
and night out to deliver the item you ordered. As humans we are
prone to mistakes and cannot work with maximum efficiency all the
time. So what if, all these was automated?</p>
<p>Compared to humans, robots can work at maximum efficiency all the
time, and are less prone to mistakes. So working on the same idea
here we present to you a completely automated warehouse. As a strong
belivers in Industrial Revolution 4.0, everything in this warehouse
is automated!</p>
<div class="section" id="so-how-it-works-what-is-the-flow">
<h2>So how it works? / What is the flow?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-how-it-works-what-is-the-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As soon as an order is received by the warehouse a camera looks at
the available packages on the shelf, finds the position of the
required package on the shelf and sends that position to a robotic
arm. The robotic arm used in this warehouse is UR5. The arm goes to
the given position and grabs the package using vaccum suction, and
places it on the conveyor belt. There is another UR5 robotic arm on
the other end of the conveyor belt. This arm picks up the package and
puts it inside a bin, there are 3 diffrent bins, each representing 3
different priority orders. This arm detects the package with the help
of yet another camera this time present on top of the conveyor belt</p>
<p>If those too many sentences confused you here is a simplified bullet
points version of the above paragraph.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Order is Received by the Warehouse</li>
<li>A camera scans for available packages on the shelf</li>
<li>Camera finds position of the required order (package) on the shelf</li>
<li>A robotic arm moves to the position of package, given by camera</li>
<li>Robotic arm grabs the package and places it on a moving conveyor belt</li>
<li>Another camera present on the other side of the conveyor belt looks for that package</li>
<li>After detecting that package, it triggers the second robotic arm which is also present on the other side of the conveyor.</li>
<li>The second robotic arm grabs the package from the moving conveyor and places it inside a bin, from where it can be loaded and delivered.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is sort of a brief summary of what we have done.</p>

<h1>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So now, let’s get into specific nitty gritty details of the implementation.</p>
<div class="section" id="incoming-orders">
<h2>Incoming Orders<a class="headerlink" href="#incoming-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The orders are sent via the <em>MQTT Protocol</em>. MQTT or Message Queue
Telemetry Transport protocol is a publish/subscribe, extremly simple
and lightweight protocol. This publish/subscribe model allows MQTT to
communicate as one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-one. It is popular
among use cases where there is low bandwidth, high-latency or
unreliable networks. MQTT also provides us with a parameter called
Quality of Service (QoS).</p>
<p>Let us discuss few of these terms in some details:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Publisher: The publisher publishes the message</li>
<li>Subscriber: The subscriber receives the message</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>QoS: MQTT protocol provides us with 3 QoS, they are as follows</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>QoS0: Message is sent but no confirmation is received</li>
<li>QoS1: Message sent atleast once, but duplicates may be received</li>
<li>QoS2: Most Reliable one, here duplicates are controlled by making sure message is sent only once.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>There is also a concept of MQTT Topics (which is similar to ROS Topics) and MQTT Broker (Broker serves as middle man through which messages are sent and received) which are not dicussed in details here</strong></p>
<p>So the incoming orders are sent via the MQTT protocol, using QoS0 and
under the topic <em>‘/eyrc/vb/iOeCqZLl/orders’</em></p>
<p>These orders are received by the ROS node <em>‘node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge’</em>. After receiveing them, it publishes them to a ROS topic <em>‘/ros_iot_bridge/mqtt/sub’</em>.
This is done inorder to make the other ROS nodes listen to what
the incoming order is, and act accordingly. The ROS node
<em>‘node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge’</em> also publishes it a Google
sheet.</p>
<p>There are three diffrent priority of orders:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>High Priority (HP):   These are the orders for Medicines</li>
<li>Medium Priority (MP): These are the orders for Food Packages</li>
<li>Low Priority (LP):    These are the orders for Clothes</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the aim is to reduce the delivery time such that HP order
takes the lowest time and LP order can take the most time to be
delivered among these 3 priority.</p>
<p>In other words, the delivery time for these diffrent priority orders
should be as: <em>HP &lt; MP &lt; LP</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="identifying-packages-from-shelf">
<h2>Identifying Packages From Shelf<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-packages-from-shelf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of identifying packages from the shelf runs indepedently
from the Incoming Orders. So whether we are receiving order or not,
a camera scans the shelf and saves list of all the available packages along with it’s priority as a key value pair. <strong>This is done only once per run.</strong> The ROS Node used to do this is <em>node_package_info</em>.</p>
<p>The packages are color coded as well as have QR code on them, to help
us identify it’s priority. The color code - priority relation is as
follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Red Color - High Priority</em></li>
<li><em>Yellow Color - Medium Priority</em></li>
<li><em>Green Color - Low Priority</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So, in order to identify the package and it’s priority we had two
options. The first, to figure out the package colour by isolating
other colours. The second, to read the QR data on the package. We
have selected second approach as that seemed much simpler and faster.</p>
<p>Here is what the camera stream looks like</p>
<img alt="_images/raw_img.png" src="_images/raw_img.png" />
<p>This camera stream is published on the ROS Topic <em>‘/eyrc/vb/camera_1/image_raw’.</em></p>
<div class="section" id="processing-the-camera-feed">
<h3>Processing the camera feed<a class="headerlink" href="#processing-the-camera-feed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you can see from the above image the camera feed is a bit dull and
smooth, basically not great to read the QR Code directly. As a result,
a bit of preprocessing was required. So here are all the preprocessing steps we followed:</p>
<p>1. Converting to Grey Scale:
Since we are going to read the QR code, there was no need of the colors in the image. So we stripped the image from it’s colors.</p>
<p>2. Bluring it:
It may seem a bit odd to blur out the image, but it helps to reduce
all the noise present in the image and we are left with only the major
constitunets of the image. The Bluring technique we applied was Gaussian Blur.</p>
<p>3. Binarizing it:
Binarizing means converting the image to black and white i.e. each
pixel can either have a value of 0 (black) or 255 (white), nothing in
between. The Binarization aka Thresholding technique we used was an
adaptive thresholding, consisting of adaptive thresh gaussian method.
Binarizing makes identifying QR code very much simpler.</p>
<p>Here is what the image looks like after processing it</p>
<img alt="_images/thresh_img.png" src="_images/thresh_img.png" />
<p>All these processing on the image was done using <em>OpenCV</em> library and
<em>pyzbar</em> was used to read the QR Codes from the image. Once all the
packages are identified they are saved as key value pair along with
its priority, it is published on the ROS topic <em>‘/pkg_task5/package_info’.</em></p>
<p>All this package information is also uploaded to a google sheet using a ROS node called <em>node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dispatching-the-package">
<h2>Dispatching The Package<a class="headerlink" href="#dispatching-the-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dispatching here means, picking up the ordered package from the shelf
and placing it on the conveyor belt.</p>
<p>Dispatching is done by a UR5 robotic arm, this arm has a vaccum
gripper as it’s end effector (EE). The ROS node which controls this
arm is named <em>node_ur5_1</em> and it is subscribed to the ROS Topics <em>‘/pkg_task5/package_info’.</em> and <em>‘/ros_iot_bridge/mqtt/sub’</em> hence it has all the necessary information like incoming orders and priority of the packages on the shelf.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-dispatch-hp-orders-packages-first">
<h3>How to dispatch HP orders packages first?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-dispatch-hp-orders-packages-first" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once an order is revceived it saves the order in a dictionary, and
also saves it in a seprate list based on it’s priorirty. There are 3
different lists for 3 different priority of orders.</p>
<p>After saving the order, it will check the list of High Prioriry
packages, if it is not empty (meaning there is a high priority order
left to dispatch) it will start processing it. And if the list is
empty, it will check the list of Medium Priority packages, and again,
if it is not empty, it will process it. Lastly, it will check the list
of the Lower Priority packages and if they are not empty it will
process it.</p>
<p>The whole process strictly follows the above order. This helps us to
dispatch the higher priority packages first, medium priority packages
second, and lower priority packages at last. Thus, helping in the
goal of delivering HP orders first, then MP, and at last LP</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-the-ur5-arm-towards-the-package">
<h3>Moving the UR5 Arm towards the package<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-the-ur5-arm-towards-the-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the node selects which order to process, it will find the
required package from the available packages. After figuring out
which package will be used to fullfill the current order, it will
play the correspoinding saved trajectory to reach there.</p>
<p><em>What is a saved trajectory? and why use it?</em></p>
<p>A trajectory is the path that the arm will take to reach the
destination pose. This trajectory can be caluclated while executing
or it can be played from a saved file, when played from a saved file
it is called saved trajectory. The reason it is used is to save time.
Calculating trajectories can take anywhere from 5 seconds to 90
seconds. Furthermore, sometimes the trajectory plannar may fail to
find a solution. Hence using saved trajectory is much more reliable and faster method.</p>
<p>After playing the saved trajectory to reach the package, the arm
activates the end effector (EE) in this case a vaccum gripper which
grips the package with the help of suction. After gripping, the node
plays yet another saved trajectory to put the package on the conveyor.
On reaching on top of the conveyor it deactivates its EE and drops
the package on top of the conveyor.</p>
<p>With this a package is dispatched successfully.</p>
<p>The node then uploads the dispatched package information like,
dispatch date and time along with other order information to the
google sheet by sending it as a goal to the <em>‘node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge’</em>. This node also publishes, the information of the package which it just dispatched on a ROS topic called <em>“/eyrc/vb/onConveyor”</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shipping-the-package">
<h2>Shipping The Package<a class="headerlink" href="#shipping-the-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Shipping here means, putting the package inside a bin from where it
can be delivered.</p>
<p>Shipping is done with the help of yet another UR5 Robotic Arm and a
logical camera. The ROS node used to do the shippping is called
<em>node_ur5_2</em>. And this node is also subscribed to ROS topic
<em>‘/pkg_task5/package_info’.</em> hence it has the package info, i.e.
which package name has what priority. ROS topic <em>“/eyrc/vb/onConveyor”</em> is subscribed by this node, hence it knows which package
is currently on the conveyor, and it’s order details.</p>
<p>A logical camera is placed on top of the conveyor and is pointing
on the the coveyor belt. As soon as it detects a package, it slows
down the conveyor belt a bit and triggers the UR5 to activate its
vaccum gripper and grab the package.</p>
<p>After grabbing the package, since it has the order details of the
package it finds out it’s priority and puts it inside the respective
priority bin. Just like for dispatching the package, here also, we
have used saved trajectories to save the time.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-priority-bins">
<h3>What are priority bins?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-priority-bins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are 3 different bins, for 3 different priority of orders. One for HP, one for MP and one for LP.</p>
<p>The node then uploads the shipped package information like,
shipped date and time, estimated date of delivery along with other
order information to the google sheet by sending it as a goal to the <em>‘node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge’</em>.</p>
